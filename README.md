# Chaos Manager 📁

A local AI-powered desktop organizer. It uses Llama 3 (via Ollama) to intelligently analyze file content and sort messy folders into logical categories.

## Features
- **Privacy First:** runs entirely offline (localhost).
- **Smart Sorting:** Uses AI to understand the meaning behind filenames, rather than simply sorting by file extension.
- **Safe:** Reviews proposed moves before executing them.

## Installation
1. Install [Ollama](https://ollama.com).
2. Run `ollama pull llama3:8b`.
3. Run the executable.
